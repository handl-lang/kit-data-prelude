# ADR-0073: State Machine Invariants via Fixpoint Discovery

## Decision


State machine invariants are discovered by the **fixpoint iteration**
in the refinement inference engine. No user annotations are required.

### How it works

1. Each transition atom has a **conditional contract**:
   - `state.dec : Int → Int`
     - `requires: Le(0, input)` — can only decrement if ≥ 0
     - `guarantee: Le(0, output)` — result is ≥ 0

2. The state machine is a loop:

   ```
   counter = loop(comp(choice(state.inc, state.dec), first(id)))
   ```

3. The inference engine runs the fixpoint:
   - I₀ = body's guarantee (includes `Le(0, output)` from `state.dec`)
   - wp(body, I₀) = the precondition needed to preserve I₀
   - For `state.dec`: wp = `Le(0, input)` (the precondition)
   - I₁ = I₀ ∧ wp(body, I₀) = `Le(0, output) ∧ Le(0, input)`
   - Fixpoint: the invariant `Le(0, count)` (Count ≥ 0) is discovered

4. The guarantee includes the invariant: `Le(0, output)`

### What works

- **Data invariants**: properties of the state value itself (Count ≥ 0,
  buffer non-empty, valid state enum)
- **Conditional transitions**: atoms with preconditions (can only
  decrement if ≥ 0, can only pop if non-empty)
- **Termination**: if the event stream is finite (consumed via the side
  channel), the loop terminates

### What doesn't work

- **Concurrency invariants**: "the buffer is never accessed by two
  threads simultaneously" — this is a concurrency property, not a data
  property. See ADR-0072.
- **Liveness properties**: "the counter eventually reaches zero" — this
  is a temporal property, not an invariant. The fixpoint discovers
  invariants (safety), not liveness.
- **Global invariants**: properties spanning multiple state machines —
  the inference is per-graph, not cross-graph.


## Why

A state machine is `State × Event ⇝ State` — it processes events and updates state. The key verification question: **what invariants hold on the state across all transitions?**

## Not doing

- none recorded — legacy record; the design doc lists what was deferred.

## Consequences

- State machine invariants discovered automatically from transition
- No user annotations — just write the state machine as an arrow graph
- Works for counters, buffers, protocol states, resource pools
- Conditional contracts (preconditions) enable invariant discovery via
- Only data invariants (safety), not liveness or concurrency

## Enforcement

- Code and tests are named in the design doc.
